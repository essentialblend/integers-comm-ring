# integers_comm_ring

In this research project, I implement naive type-theoretical proofs to formalize abstract mathematical structures using Agda. This involves building every proof and construct from scratch, reasoning about them intuitionistically. 

The final solution involves a variable of the type "Ring" which satisfies all the commutative ring axioms.

Agda Codebase for "The Commutative Ring of Integers"
ver: 2.6.3

Library for all the code used for the dissertation.

This project consists of four main folders.

- constructs: Basic types and tools required for our proofs.

- natural_numbers: Definition, operations and properties over Natural Numbers.

- integers_MAIN: Definition, operations and properties over Integers. Main folder of interest.

- predicate_logic: Tools required for predicates.

P.S - I'm currently improving my thesis based on the feedback, and will provide it here soon.
